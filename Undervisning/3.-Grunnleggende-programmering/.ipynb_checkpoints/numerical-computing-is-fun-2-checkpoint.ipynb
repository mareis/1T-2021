    "Sometimes you hear the word 'binary' related with computers. Binary just means that there are two options, 0 and 1. This has to do with the way computers work; the processor of the computer is made of billions of tiny gates. These tiny gates can only peform one action, they can open or close. Related with this, there is a system of logic called boolean logic. Boolean means the same thing as binary, that there are only two possible states. Instead of talking about gates or 0 and 1, in Boolean logic we talk about 'True' and 'False'. Either something is true, or it's false. When you hear about Boolean Logic for the first time, it sounds confusing, but actually it is really as simple as that. Understanding this clearly, you take a giant leap in understanding computers. Boolean logic, and the statements we use to instruct the computer based on that type of simplistic logic, is the language of computers. Python gives us humans an easy to learn and understand way to use boolean logic to tell computers what we want them to do. Let's see a couple of examples."

Actually all numbers are divisible by 1 and itself, so this is to say it's not divisible. Also numbers can't be divisible by numbers that are larger than the number itself, so it's enough to check all the numbers between 1 and the number itself to get the answer if a given number is prime or not. This sounds fine as long as we deal with small numbers, but how about when we want to answer the same question for a very large number. Because it's so easy to say if small numbers are prime or not, mathematicians are only interested in finding really big primes. In the next section we'll learn just how big, and then come back to learn how big numbers can be verified using the techniques we've learn already."

    "WOW! That's a lot of pages just to print one number. One of the most powerful computers in the world was able to verify that this indeed is a prime number, after working years just to do that. Actually it's not just one computer, but a network of almost 200,000 computers that are dedicating their available resources to looking for the next big prime number. It's called [GIMPS](https://www.mersenne.org/). That's pretty cool stuff right?"

    "To be realistic, we're not going to find such a big number with our small lonely computer, but what we can do, is create a simple program that more or less does what the gigantic network of computers in GIMPS do. For now, let's wrap up here and continue in the next part, where we will learn about putting the building blocks we already have, and create our very first algoritm.

    "\n",
    "- Prime numbers relate with divisibility\n",
    "- Divisibility means that when one number is divided by other, the product is not a whole number\n",
    "- A prime number is any number that is divisible only by itself and 1\n",
    "- Binary means 0 and 1\n",
    "- Boolean logic is the binary language of computers \n",
    "- Python gives us an easy to use way to instruct computers\n",
    "- Boolean logic statements involve 'is', 'is not', 'and' and 'or' statements\n",
    "- Boolean statements can be joined together\n",
    "- Boolean statements always return either True or False as output\n",
    "- It's easy to perform computing operations with small numbers\n",
    "- The biggest prime number is a really big number\n",
    "- Very big numbers require vast networks of computers joined together\n",

    "While it may seem that we are dealing with very simple things, actually we've already covered some of the most important concepts of computer programming. You're on your way to knowing how to tell computers what you want them to do!"
